## ‚≠ê Overview

QuickCourt is a modern, full-stack platform designed to revolutionize sports venue discovery, booking, and management for enthusiasts and facility owners alike.

> In today's fast-paced world, finding and reserving a suitable sports venue can often be a frustrating, time-consuming process involving phone calls, scattered information, and uncertain availability. Venue owners, on the other hand, struggle with manual booking systems, inefficient scheduling, and a lack of tools to reach their audience and optimize their operations.

QuickCourt provides an elegant, intuitive solution to these challenges. It offers a seamless user experience for customers to browse, filter, and book courts in real-time, while empowering venue owners with powerful tools for managing their facilities, schedules, and customer interactions. From real-time availability and secure payments to comprehensive dashboards and detailed analytics, QuickCourt brings efficiency and convenience to the sports booking ecosystem.

This project is built with a clear separation of concerns, featuring a **React-based frontend application** for a dynamic user interface and a **robust Node.js Express backend API** powered by TypeScript for scalable and secure operations. The two components communicate via RESTful API calls, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get QuickCourt up and running on your local machine, follow these instructions.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: `v18.x` or higher (includes npm)
*   **npm**: `v9.x` or higher (usually comes with Node.js)
*   **MySQL**: A running MySQL database instance.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Darsh-8-Team-Cupertino-QuickCourt-44d4c5c/quickcourt.git
    cd quickcourt
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install its dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory by copying `.env.example` and filling in your database credentials and other necessary configurations.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Open .env and configure your MySQL connection string, JWT secret, etc.
    ```

    Set up the database schema and seed initial data:

    ```bash
    npm run setup-db
    npm run seed # Optional: Populates the database with sample data
    ```

    Then, navigate back to the project root:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Install the frontend dependencies from the project root directory:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## üîß Usage

Follow these steps to run the QuickCourt application locally.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    Open your first terminal, navigate to the `backend` directory, and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend API will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file). The API documentation will be accessible at `/api-docs`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**

    Open a second terminal, navigate to the project root directory, and start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    cd .. # Ensure you are in the project root
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite).

3.  **Explore the Application:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`). You can now register, log in, browse venues, and make bookings.

    **Example API Request (using `curl`):**

    You can test the backend directly using `curl`. For instance, to fetch a list of venues:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/venues
    ```
    (Note: The exact endpoint might vary based on your API versioning and routing).
